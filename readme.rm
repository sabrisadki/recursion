Algorithm: is_palindrome
This algorithm takes a string as input and returns True if the input string is a palindrome and False otherwise.

Variables:
Palind : A boolean variable used to store the result of the palindrome check.
word : A string variable used to store the input word from the user.
wordlower : A string variable used to store the lower case version of the input word.
i : An integer variable used as an index in the first for loop.
j : An integer variable used as an index in the second for loop.
Input:
The user is prompted to enter a word.
Output:
Palind is True if the input string is a palindrome and False otherwise.
Algorithm Instructions:
Prompt the user to enter a word.
If the length of the input word is less than or equal to 1, set Palind to True and go to step 7.
Convert the input word to lower case and store it in the wordlower variable.
Start a for loop with i from 0 to the length of the wordlower string.
Start another for loop with j from the length of the wordlower string to 0.
Compare the i-th character of wordlower to the j-th character of wordlower. If they are the same, increment i and decrement j. If they are different, set Palind to False and exit the inner loop.
If Palind is not set to False by the end of the loop, set it to True.
Output the value of Palind.
Example:
vbnet
Copy code
Input: "racecar"
Output: True

Input: "hello"
Output: False
Note:
This algorithm only checks for palindromes in single words. It does not consider phrases or sentences.
